There are 3 ways to create a 3d instance:
1) from the 'Add object' menu - a mesh(with a three geometry) with wireframe, later might include drawn objects*
2) from 'settings'(import object) menu or 'ready objects' menu - a THREE.Object3D with numerous children - pairs of meshes and corresponding wireframes
3) from the 'draw' in 'settings' menu - can be point / line / mesh - a THREE Points/Line2/ConvexGeometry with a parent, which is either the scene or an instance of 1)

Hover
	if an object is hovered its color will change to slightly lighter (using the .Color property as infoormation source)
	if the parent of a 3) is hovered the 3) will change color

updateGroupGeometry()
	every time a 1) or 3) is altered, the change is handled here including at creation

updateDrawnObject()
	when the parent of a point of a 3) is moved/rotated, the said vertice is displaced as well => the 3) gets altered

createObject()
	function for correct changing of the geometry and using updateGroupGeometry + making the gui of the object

init()
	the plane is for easier movement of objects and correct position of mouse in the 3d plane

fileIsLocal
	if the file is downloaded there will be the version and defaultFont variables
	it is automatically updated with the online version at first click
