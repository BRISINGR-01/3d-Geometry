A 3D playground for interacting with three js in-built object as well as a few I created.<br> 
Files with .obj extention can be imported.<br>
The scene can be exported int a .obj file.<br>
A few .obj and .pbd objects are available. The .obj are from my other project [Ablanitsa](https://github.com/BRISINGR-01/Ablanitsa) and the .pbd are chemical compounds with the idea taken from [three js chemistry](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_loader_pdb)<br>
